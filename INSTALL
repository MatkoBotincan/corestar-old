The jStar Verification System
=============================

To build jStar, you will need to have the most recent version OCaML
installed [1].

To run the build process: 
  $ make 

This will generate the jstar executable file:
  ./bin/jstar

To run all of the tests in the examples directory: 
  $ make test 

There is a tutorial for the tool here:
   ./doc/tutorial/jstartut.pdf
