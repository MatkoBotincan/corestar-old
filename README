The jStar Verification System
=============================

To build jStar, you will need to have the most recent version OCaML
installed [1].

To run the build process, simply call: 
  $ make 

This will generate the following executable file for jstar:
  ./bin/jstar

To run all of the tests in the examples directory: 
  $ make test 

There is a tutorial for the tool here:
   ./doc/tutorial/jstartut.pdf

Note: The OCaml release that is included in the most recent version of
Cygwin (1.7.2) is 3.08.1 which is too old. Just download the sources of
the latest OCaml release (currently 3.11.2) and compile them under
Cygwin following the instructions provided in the INSTALL file.
