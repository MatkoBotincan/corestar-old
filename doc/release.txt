All UNIX releases *must* conform to what experienced users expect.
  tar xaf jstar-VERSION.tar.bz2
  cd jstar-VERSION
  ./configure --prefix=HOME # may fail with 'Install such and such.'
  make
  make test
  make install # may fail due to file permissions, but should always work as root
  HOME/bin/jstar

The commands above may fail only if at least one of these holds:
 1. Reasonable versions of bash, tar, bunzip2, bash, GNU Make are
    are not available.
 2. The command ./configure notices that some dependency is unmet.
 3. The command 'make install' is run without super-user privilege and
    there are some permission problems.
To make this more precise, "reasonable version" means whatever version
shipped with the latest Ubuntu LTS at the date of the release.

Any other failure is a bug in the release.

Mandatory testing: The above procedure must work on the latest Ubuntu LTS,
with HOME=/, HOME=~, and HOME=~/temp.
